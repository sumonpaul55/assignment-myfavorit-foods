        <p><b>Sushi:</b> Sushi is a Japanese dish consisting of small balls or rolls of vinegar-flavored cold cooked
            rice, usually served with raw seafood, vegetables, or egg. Sushi is often enjoyed with soy sauce, wasabi,
            and pickled ginger.</p>
        <p><b>Pad Thai:</b> Pad Thai is a popular Thai dish made with stir-fried rice noodles, eggs, vegetables,
            peanuts, and your choice of protein (such as chicken, shrimp, or tofu). The dish is often seasoned with fish
            sauce, tamarind, sugar, and chili flakes to create a sweet, sour, and slightly spicy flavor.</p>
        <p><b>Peking duck: </b> Peking duck is a Chinese dish that originated in Beijing. It is a roasted duck dish that
            is typically served with thin pancakes, scallions, cucumber, and a sweet bean sauce. The skin of the duck is
            crispy and the meat is tender and flavorful.</p>
        <p><b>Tacos al pastor:</b> Tacos al pastor is a popular Mexican street food made with marinated pork cooked on a
            spit, similar to the Middle Eastern shawarma. The pork is thinly sliced and served on soft corn tortillas
            with cilantro, onions, and pineapple. The dish is typically served with a side of lime wedges and hot sauce.
